%Iph0.txt is a file that lists the photosaturation current as detected by semi-automatic or manual routines and is used by an_sweepmain.m for sweep analysis
%the format is:
% UTC, OBT, Iph0, description
% where:
% UTC= "UTC TIME YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ffffff"
% OBT= SPACECRAFT ONBOARD TIME SSSSSSSSS.FFFFFF (TRUE DECIMALPOINT)"
% Iph0 = Photosaturation value in Ampere
% description = Human readable description of the Iph0 value specified
% first iteration of Iph0.txt should list the photosaturation ampere that should be used from respective point in time.
% further iterations of this file or the routine that uses this file should incorprate an interpolation routine, preferably as a function of distance to Sun and/or a function of a relevant sunflux estimate, like Mg-II band F10.7
