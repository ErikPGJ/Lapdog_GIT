This file specifies the SPICE kernels to be loaded by the custom Rosetta SPICE functions. Specifically, the paths to the parent directories of the kernel files are given under PATH_VALUES and assigned symbolic names under PATH_SYMBOLS. These symbolic names are then used to specify the kernels to load under KERNELS_TO_LOAD. (This file starts in comment mode. The actual data file begins after the begindata line.)

\begintext
(After the begintext line we again find ourselves in comment mode.) Above, SPK was defined to point to the parent directory of the Rosetta kernel files. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT THE PARENT DIRECTORY OF THE KERNEL FILES BE CORRECTLY SPECIFIED! Change the PATH_VALUES line to give the search path to this directory on your machine, otherwise the custom Rosetta SPICE functions will not work for you.
   Furthermore, MICE was defined to point to the mice directory. paths.m uses this to find the required mice paths. This also has to be adjusted to the right path on your machine!
