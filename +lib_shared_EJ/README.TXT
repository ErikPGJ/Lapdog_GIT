Files under this directory are generic utility functions from Erik P G Johansson's private MATLAB files.

These files are kept in a separate MATLAB package to
(1) keep them easily recognizable,
(2) make it easy to exchange modifications between Lapdog versions and Erik P G Johansson's private versions (both directions) while at the same time (2a) simultaneously keeping both versions available on the MATLAB path when developing, (2b) avoiding name conflicts by using different MATLAB packages (MATLAB does not call the wrong version), and (2c) while being able to diff and/or copy files in any one direction (copy Erik's files to Lapdog or vice versa) with as few modifications as possible (e.g. renaming rare function calls).
