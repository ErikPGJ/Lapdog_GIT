Orientation constants for Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
------------------------------------------------------

     The direction of the rotation axis and the rotation period are based on
     as of 2012-Mar-30.

     The phase of the rotation is chosen so that at the reference time
     2014-08-07T12:00:00 TDB the axis of the rotation from J2000 to the comet
     fixed frame is prependicular to the z-axis.

     An ellipsoid of the same volume as the polyhedron shape model was fitted
     to the shape model. The optimisation criterion was maximum common volume. 
     The smallest radius of the ellipsoid was restricted to be along the 
     z-axis.

     \begintext

     In order to use the ellipsoid shape model with correct orientation
     relative to the polyhedron shape model, an auxiliary frame with
     appropriate rotation relative to the body fixed frame is needed. Such
     a frame named 67P/C-G_ELLIPSOID is provided in the kernel ROS_CGS_AUX_V01.TF.
     E.g., in calls to SINCPT, the name 67P/C-G_ELLIPSOID has to be passed
     as body-fixed, body-centered target body frame.
